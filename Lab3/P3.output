Problem 3 Write up:
The main thing that I took away from these tests of the compareTo method is that for one symbol to be larger than another that It has to come before the other symbol.
For instance, 9 is greater than 1 as far as value is concerned but because 1 comes before 9, compareTo favors it.  
Also capital letters are greater than lower case leters, and symbols are greater than both numbers and letters.
