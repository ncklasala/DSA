Because My Driver will calculate both the binomial coefficent and pascals triangle for any input, I seperated parts of the output
For Clarity I kept the complete outputs for (7,7) (6,3) and (0,0) to show how it is actually outputing what is being looked for.  The rest I trimmed and shuffled as i saw appropriate.
